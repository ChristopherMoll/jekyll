        title: Oral Sedation
        body: "Oral medications can be provided to patients who are anxious, but prefer
              to remain in a more conscious state throughout the procedure. Oral medications will provide
              patients with some relaxation, while still being able to respond to all commands and stimuli. Oral
              sedation is not ideal for everyone as we are unable to titrate (re-dose) oral medications"

      body: "Provides the ability to titrate intravenous medications to achieve levels of minimal, moderate
             or deep sedation. Based on the patients medical history and the dental treatment plan, an
             individual anesthetic plan (level of sedation) is established to provide a patient with a safe,
             comfortable and pain-free visit at the dental office."

      title: General Anesthesia
      body: "Is administered through inhaled gas or through intravenous medications providing a patient to
             an unconscious state. Through a cocktail of medications, the patient may require a supplemental
             airway, however this is not a definitive measure as a patient undergoing general anesthesia may
             still breath on their own."

      title: Nitrous Oxide
      body: "Also known as \"Laughing Gas\" is an inhalational agent mixed with oxygen to provide some comfort
             during a dental procedure. It is not intended to put you to \"sleep\". You will be conscious and
             will be able to hear and respond to any requests and stimuli."
