         pre-determination of estimated reimbursement and costs for which the patient will be responsible. This process
         usually takes at least 2 weeks. Once a pre-determination is received, the patient can choose to have the doctor
          or themselves reimbursed. If the patient wishes to have the doctor reimbursed through insurance, a
          pre-determination must be obtained before the appointment and the patient will be responsible for the
