- title: Adults
  description: "Nearly 6 out of every 10 adults who visit the dentist require sedation or anesthesia due to a variety of
   reasons. These adults include those who do not like someone working in their mouth, have anxiety about visiting the
   dentist or dental treatment, are unable to get numb with local anesthesia, have a fear of needles, or have an
   uncontrollable gag reflex. Additionally some adults just prefer sedation in the dental office to efficiently complete
    their lengthy amount of dental treatment in one appointment."

- title: Special Needs
  description: "Patients with Special needs include a diverse group. A fear of the unknown, lack of familiarity with the
   office or just an inability to cooperate with the doctor, presents a challenge to treat this population without the
   use of sedation. With the use of sedation in dental office patients with physical, mental, and emotional disabilities
    can receive the neccessary dental care in the safe and efficient manner."

- title: Children
  description: "Children are ideal candidates for sedation in the dental office, due to their need for dental treatment
  and their fear of the unknown/dentist. Anesthesia can be an adjunct to dental treatment for the fearful or
  uncoopertive child. Children's fear of painful dental treatment and multiple local anesthesia injections can frighten
  a child which can result in a life long fear of the dentist. Sedation in the office will safely alleviate any fear and
  anxiety a child would face otherwise."

- title: Complete Treatment
  description: "Patients of all ages often elect for sedation for the extensive and complete dental treatment.
  Anesthesia provides the ability for the patient to be comfortable and relaxed while their entire dental treatment is
  completed in one appointment. Procedures such as implant dentistry, full mouth rehabilitation, oral surgery,
  periodontal surgery, root canal therapy, anesthesia services could provide increased patient comfort for the
  completion of the complete dental treatment in only one visit."
