- question: How does a Dentist Anesthesiologist differ from a dentist who offers IV Sedation or Sleep Dentistry
  answer: "There are several differences between a dentist that provides sedation and the services provided by a
          dentist anesthesiologist. A dentist that provides only sedation completes a continuing education course
          and is limited to administering one type of anesthesia: conscious sedation, usually with one or two
          drugs. A dentist anesthesiologist can administer all levels of anesthesia – sedation through general
          anesthesia – using a variety of anesthetic agents and anesthetic techniques. In the field of dentistry,
          dentist anesthesiologists are the experts of anesthesia. Dentist anesthesiologists are often the
          instructors who teach other dentists their sedation courses. Dr. Mendia is a dentist anesthesiologist."

- question: I have not performed dentistry on an anesthetized patient before. Is this a problem?
  answer: "This is not a problem at all.  We are here to answer all of your questions.   Dr. Mendia will walk you
          through each step of the process and make sure you are comfortable.  Many dentists prefer treating
          their patients this way because it’s easy and productive."

- question: Why is Anesthesia Necessary?
  answer: "Complex Dental cases, needle phobic or anxious patients, patients with special needs and children may
          require anesthesia. The degree of anesthesia in such cases can vary between moderate to deep sedation
          and general anesthesia. Dr. Mendia is well trained at providing all levels of anesthesia so that your
          dentist can fully focus on your oral procedure. This allows for a safer, more predictable and
          comfortable experience for both the patient and the dentist. Anesthesia is important because it
          eliminates pain and anxiety during the procedure, allowing the dentist more time to perform complicated
          procedures and reduce physical shock and emotional stress."
